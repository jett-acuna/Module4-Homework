# Module4-Homework
This is my submission for the 4th module challenge, for the RICE Fintech Bootcamp 2023. This module was definitely more challenging than the last 2 and gave me a run for my money! I did not end up finishing the assignment, so I am turning in what I have done and hopefully I can turn in the full assignment on a later date!
